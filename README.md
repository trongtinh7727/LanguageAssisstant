<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

## Project Overview
LanguageAssistant is designed to support users in learning English vocabulary through a flashcard-based system, similar to Quizlet. Users can create and manage vocabulary topics, and engage in various learning activities such as quizzes and exercises.

**Compatibility:** This project is designed to work with Android 11 and above. You can install the `LanguageAssistant.apk` to run the application on your Android device.

## Account Features
- **Register a new account**
- **User login**
- **Password recovery via email**
- **Settings Screen**
  - **Profile Screen:** Users can review and update their profile information and avatar.
  - **Change Password:** Users can change their password on demand.

## Vocabulary Management
A vocabulary list (topic) is a group of related words, such as "color vocabulary" or "food vocabulary". Folders can be used to group related topics together.

- **Create/Edit/Delete a Topic:** View and manage the list of topics (topics can be created without any folder).
- **Add/Remove/Adjust Words in a Topic**
- **Import and Export Topics:** Supports .csv format.
- **Create/Edit/Delete a Folder:** View and manage the list of folders.
- **Add/Remove Topics in a Folder**
- **Manage Details of a Topic:**
  - View all English words and their Vietnamese meanings.
  - Listen to pronunciation (text to speech) by clicking on the words.
  - Star/mark words to include in a separate learning list.
  - Track the status of each word (not learned, currently learning, mastered).

## Learning Features
These learning features are provided in three separate modes. Users can choose the mode they prefer:

- **Flashcard:** The front displays one language, and the back displays the other language; click to switch sides.
- **Quiz:** Display the English word with 4 Vietnamese choices for users to select (and vice versa).
- **Type:** Display the Vietnamese meaning and ask the user to type the English meaning (and vice versa).

## Community Features
- **Access Visibility:** Owners can set visibility (private/public) for a topic.
- **Public Topics:** Allow users to see and participate in learning on public topics.
- **Display Rankings:** Users can see rankings for a specific topic based on:
  - Most correct answers
  - Fastest completion time (with 100% accuracy)
  - Most times studied
- **Achievements:** Users can view their achievements in their profiles.

This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of developing a vocabulary learning app, providing features for managing vocabulary, learning, and community interaction.
